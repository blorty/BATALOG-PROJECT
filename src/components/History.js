        <p>Batman is a superhero from DC Comics, created in 1939 by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. He is actually Bruce Wayne, a rich philanthropist who lives in Gotham City. As a child, Bruce saw his parents killed and vowed to fight against crime. He trained himself and became Batman, patrolling the city at night to fight against villains like the Joker, Penguin, and Riddler. Batman doesn't have any superpowers, but instead relies on his intellect, wealth, and fighting skills. He's been depicted in many comics, and has been part of the Justice League and Outsiders. Many other characters have taken on the Batman persona over the years. Batman is an iconic character who has been adapted into films, television shows, video games, and toys.</p>
        <p>Bob Kane, the creator of Batman, originally drew a character with a red costume and bat wings, but collaborator Bill Finger suggested changes to the character's appearance, including a cowl instead of a simple mask and a cape instead of wings. Finger also suggested the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity, drawing inspiration from Robert the Bruce and "Mad" Anthony Wayne. Kane and Finger drew inspiration from various sources, including pulp fiction, newspaper headlines, and popular culture of the 1930s, to create Batman's look, personality, methods, and weaponry. They also drew upon the aristocratic hero with a double identity archetype, with Batman's predecessors being the Scarlet Pimpernel and Zorro. Finally, Finger made the character a master sleuth, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes such as Doc Savage, The Shadow, Dick Tracy, and Sherlock Holmes.</p>

 Bruce Wayne, also known as Batman, witnessed the murder of his parents as a child and was motivated to seek justice against criminals. Bruce Wayne is a wealthy American industrialist who lives in Wayne Manor, located on the outskirts of Gotham City. He uses his inherited conglomerate, Wayne Enterprises, to maintain the facade of a playboy, while secretly using it to support philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his time is primarily occupied by his vigilante activities as Batman. His principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill. Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity, and his vigilante activities are a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better. The writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two characters. Grant Morrison notes that both heroes "believe in the same kind of things" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display, and T. James Musler explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman. Will Brooker notes that the confirmation of Batman's identity lies with the young audience, who trust him because of his morality and humanity, regardless of his true identity.</p>
